# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The code provided here analyzes a dataset containing various features related to credit card transactions, such as time, amount, and anonymized features V1 to V28.

## Getting Started

To use this code, make sure you have Python installed along with the required packages mentioned in the code (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

## Description of the Dataset

The dataset (`creditC.csv`) consists of the following columns:
- Time: Time between transactions
- Amount: Amount of the transaction
- V1...V28: Anonymized features for privacy reasons
- Class: Response variable indicating fraud (1) or valid transaction (0)

## Usage

1. Import the necessary packages:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import gridspec
```

2. Load the dataset:

```python
data = pd.read_csv("creditC.csv")
```

3. Explore the dataset using various data analysis techniques provided in the code.

## Analysis

The provided code performs the following analyses:
- Descriptive statistics of the dataset
- Checking for missing values and unique values
- Determining the imbalance in the data
- Analyzing details of fraudulent and normal transactions
- Preparing the data for training and testing

## Results

- The dataset contains a minimal percentage of fraudulent cases, indicating an imbalance in the data.
- The average amount in fraudulent transactions tends to be higher than in normal transactions.

## Next Steps

Further steps could include:
- Implementing machine learning models for fraud detection
- Evaluating model performance and fine-tuning parameters
- Deploying the model for real-time fraud detection
